# Hybrid Search Testing Guide

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

Your app now has **3 search modes** with intelligent adaptive mode selection:

### 1. **Semantic Search** 🧠
- Uses embeddings to find **conceptually similar** content
- Best for natural language questions
- Example: "How does a blockchain work?"

### 2. **Keyword Search** 🔤
- Uses BM25 full-text search for **exact matches**
- Best for acronyms, IDs, technical terms
- Example: "BTC proof-of-work consensus"

### 3. **Hybrid Search** 🔀 (Recommended)
- Combines semantic + keyword with **adaptive alpha**
- Best of both worlds
- Automatically adjusts balance based on your query

---

## 📋 How to Test from Your End

### Step 1: Start Your Dev Server
```bash
cd "c:\Users\KIIT\Desktop\crypto protocol auditor\crypto-auditor-app"
npm run dev
```

The app will start at `http://localhost:3001` (or the next available port).

### Step 2: Open the App
Navigate to the app in your browser. You'll see:
- New **Search Mode Selector** buttons: 🧠 Semantic | 🔤 Keyword | 🔀 Hybrid
- Default mode is **Hybrid** (🔀) - recommended

### Step 3: Run Test Queries

#### Test 1: Acronym/ID Query
```
Query: "BTC"
Recommended Mode: 🔤 Keyword (or let 🔀 Hybrid auto-detect)
What to expect: Results with "BTC" in them will rank higher
```

#### Test 2: Natural Language Query
```
Query: "How does proof-of-work function?"
Recommended Mode: 🧠 Semantic (or let 🔀 Hybrid auto-detect)
What to expect: Results about consensus mechanisms, proof-of-work concepts
```

#### Test 3: Mixed Query (Best for Hybrid)
```
Query: "Bitcoin's PoW consensus mechanism"
Recommended Mode: 🔀 Hybrid (auto-detects as mixed)
What to expect: Combines both exact matches (PoW) + conceptual similarity
```

#### Test 4: Specific Terminology
```
Query: "proof-of-work"
Recommended Mode: 🔀 Hybrid or 🔤 Keyword
What to expect: Results mentioning the specific term
```

#### Test 5: Conceptual Query
```
Query: "What are the differences between consensus mechanisms?"
Recommended Mode: 🧠 Semantic or 🔀 Hybrid
What to expect: Results about various consensus types
```

## 🔍 What to Look For in Results

Each result card shows:
1. **Search Mode Badge** (top-left)
   - 🧠 Semantic
   - 🔤 Keyword
   - 🔀 Hybrid

2. **Relevance Score** (top-right, color-coded)
   - 🟢 Green (>80%) - Highly relevant
   - 🔵 Blue (>70%) - Relevant
   - 🟡 Yellow (<70%) - Moderately relevant

3. **Metadata Cards**
   - Source: Which whitepaper/document
   - Category: L1, DeFi, etc.
   - Chunk Index: Which part of document

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Adaptive Alpha Detection
The app automatically adjusts search strategy based on your query:

| Query Pattern | Detected As | Alpha Used | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BTC`, `ETH`, `POW` | Acronyms | 0.3 | Favor keyword matching |
| `12345`, `order-xyz` | IDs | 0.3 | Need exact matches |
| `proof-of-work` | Terminology | 0.7 | Semantic understanding important |
| `consensus algorithm` | Conceptual | 0.7 | Semantic similarity key |
| `Bitcoin's PoW consensus` | Mixed | 0.5 | Balanced approach |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Can toggle between 🧠, 🔤, 🔀 modes
- [ ] Search results appear with correct mode badge
- [ ] Relevance scores are calculated correctly
- [ ] Results are sorted by relevance (highest first)

### Adaptive Mode Testing
- [ ] Acronym queries automatically use keyword-heavy mode
- [ ] Natural language queries automatically use semantic mode
- [ ] Mixed queries balance both approaches
- [ ] Alpha values are correctly logged in console (F12)

### Quality of Results
- [ ] Acronym queries: BTC, ETH, PoW return relevant results
- [ ] Natural language: Results are contextually appropriate
- [ ] Hybrid queries: Both exact matches and concepts appear

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Mode selector buttons are clearly visible
- [ ] Mode badges in results are obvious
- [ ] Relevance color codes are intuitive
- [ ] Loading state shows proper animation
- [ ] Error messages are clear

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Console Logs
Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab:
```javascript
// Look for:
"Search Mode: hybrid"
"Alpha Value: 0.5"
"API Response Data: [...]"
"First result: {...}"
```

### Check Backend Logs
In your terminal where `npm run dev` runs, look for:
```
Search Mode: hybrid
Alpha Value: 0.5
Executing Query: SELECT ...
Query Result: {...}
First parsed row: {...}
```

### Common Issues

**Issue: Results show "Unnamed Project" / "Unknown Source"**
- ✅ This is fixed with the hybrid search code
- Check browser console for metadata parsing
- Ensure API is returning proper JSON

**Issue: All queries use same mode**
- Check if you're manually selecting a mode
- Hybrid mode should auto-detect query type
- Look at console logs for detected alpha value

**Issue: Different results between modes**
- ✅ Expected! Semantic finds concepts, keyword finds exact matches
- Try mixed queries to see the difference
- Relevance scores will differ

---

## 📊 Performance Comparison

Expected behavior when comparing modes:

```
Query: "Bitcoin consensus"

🧠 Semantic Mode:
- High scores for: consensus mechanisms, blockchain concepts
- May miss: exact "Bitcoin" mentions with lower relevance

🔤 Keyword Mode:
- High scores for: exact "Bitcoin" and "consensus" matches
- May miss: conceptually similar but differently worded content

🔀 Hybrid Mode (Recommended):
- Balances both approaches
- Gets both exact matches AND conceptually similar results
```

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Your hybrid search is ready when:

1. ✅ Three search modes are selectable (🧠 🔤 🔀)
2. ✅ Hybrid mode auto-detects query type and adjusts alpha
3. ✅ Search mode badge appears on each result
4. ✅ Results are properly ranked by relevance
5. ✅ Metadata displays correctly (source, category, etc.)
6. ✅ Console logs show correct alpha values
7. ✅ Different query types produce appropriately different results
8. ✅ No errors in browser console or terminal

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified the hybrid search works:

1. **Test with Edge Cases**
   - Very short queries: "PoW"
   - Very long queries: full paragraph
   - Special characters: "DAO-123"

2. **Optimize Results**
   - Fine-tune alpha thresholds if needed
   - Adjust relevance threshold for filtering

3. **Implement Live Data**
   - Add crypto price lookup agent
   - Combine with hybrid search for comprehensive answers

4. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Filter by project_id
   - Filter by category
   - Date range filtering
   - Custom alpha slider

## 💬 Questions?

If results don't match expectations:
1. Check console logs for alpha values
2. Verify query is being interpreted correctly
3. Try explicitly choosing a mode vs hybrid auto-detect
4. Look at the metadata - is it matching the right documents?

Good luck! 🎉
