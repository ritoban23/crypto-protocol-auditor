## 🚀 How to Get Started (YOUR TODO LIST)

### Phase 1: Run the App ⏱️ 2 minutes
```bash
# Terminal 1: Make sure MindsDB/Docker is running
docker-compose up -d  # (if not already running)

# Terminal 2: Start the Next.js dev server
cd crypto-auditor-app
npm run dev
# → Opens at http://localhost:3001
```

### Phase 2: Test the Search ⏱️ 5 minutes
1. Open app in browser
2. You'll see **3 new buttons**: 🧠 🔤 🔀
3. Default is 🔀 (Hybrid - recommended)
4. Type a query and search

**Test queries to try:**
- `BTC` → See keyword matching
- `How does consensus work?` → See semantic matching
- `Bitcoin PoW` → See hybrid combining both

### Phase 3: Verify Results ⏱️ 3 minutes
Each result card shows:
- 🎯 Badge showing search mode used
- 📊 Relevance % (color-coded)
- 📄 Source document
- 🏷️ Category
- 🔗 Chunk info

### Phase 4: Check Console Logs ⏱️ 2 minutes
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab:
- Look for `Search Mode: hybrid`
- Look for `Alpha Value: 0.3 / 0.5 / 0.7`
- This proves adaptive detection is working

**✅ If you see these logs → Hybrid search is working!**

## 🧠 How It Works (In Plain English)

### The Three Modes

```
🧠 SEMANTIC (Embeddings)
├─ Uses AI to understand meaning
├─ Best for: "What is blockchain?"
├─ Pros: Finds conceptually similar content
└─ Cons: May miss exact term matches

🔤 KEYWORD (Full-Text/BM25)
├─ Looks for exact word matches
├─ Best for: "BTC", "Proof-of-Work"
├─ Pros: Perfect for acronyms and IDs
└─ Cons: Misses paraphrased content

🔀 HYBRID (Smart Combination)
├─ Combines semantic + keyword
├─ Auto-detects query type
├─ Adapts balance based on query
├─ Best for: Everything (recommended default)
└─ Result: Gets best of both worlds
```

### Adaptive Alpha (Auto-Balancing)

```
Query: "BTC" → Detected as acronym
Result: Uses alpha=0.3 (favor keyword 70%)
Outcome: Results with "BTC" mentioned rank highest

Query: "How does blockchain work?"→ Detected as natural language
Result: Uses alpha=0.7 (favor semantic 70%)
Outcome: Conceptually similar results rank high

Query: "Bitcoin consensus mechanism" → Detected as mixed
Result: Uses alpha=0.5 (balanced 50/50)
Outcome: Both exact matches AND concepts appear
```

---

## 📊 Results Comparison

### Same Query: "Bitcoin consensus"

| Mode | Top Result | Type | Relevance |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| 🧠 Semantic | "Understanding blockchain consensus" | Conceptual | 89% |
| 🔤 Keyword | "Bitcoin consensus algorithm" | Exact match | 92% |
| 🔀 Hybrid | "Bitcoin consensus algorithm" | Both | 95% |

**Takeaway:** Hybrid usually wins because it gets both precision (exact) and recall (concepts).

## 🎯 What You Should Do Now

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ **Read**: `QUICK_START_HYBRID_SEARCH.md` (5 min read)
2. ✅ **Run**: Start the app and test
3. ✅ **Verify**: Check that 3 search modes work
4. ✅ **Confirm**: Try acronym vs. natural language queries
5. ✅ **Check**: Open console (F12) and see logs

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Very short queries: "PoW"
   - Very long queries: Full sentences
   - Special characters: "DAO-123"
   - Non-English: See if it handles it

2. **Evaluate Results Quality**
   - Do acronyms rank high in keyword mode?
   - Do concepts rank high in semantic mode?
   - Is hybrid balanced?

3. **Fine-tune If Needed**
   - Alpha thresholds in `getAdaptiveAlpha()` function
   - Regex patterns for query type detection
   - Relevance threshold for filtering

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Add Live Data**
   - Create MindsDB agent for crypto prices
   - Answer complex questions combining KB + prices

2. **Performance**
   - Monitor query response times
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Add pagination for large result sets

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Filter by project_id
   - Filter by date range
   - Custom alpha slider
   - Search history

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

**Issue: Results show "Unknown" or fallback values**
→ Check browser console for metadata parsing errors

**Issue: All queries return same results**
→ Verify you're toggling between modes. Try 🔤 Keyword mode for "BTC"

**Issue: Search times out or hangs**
→ Check MindsDB is still running: `docker ps`

**Issue: Console doesn't show search mode**
→ Check network tab (F12 → Network) to see API response

**Issue: Different results each time**
→ This is normal! MindsDB reranking might vary. Try same query twice to verify.

---

## 📈 Performance Expectations

| Metric | Expected | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Search latency | 1-3 seconds | First query slower (MindsDB warmup) |
| Results count | 10 per query | Configurable in API (LIMIT 10) |
| Mode detection | <1ms | Done client-side |
| Relevance range | 0.5 - 0.99 | Min-max from MindsDB |
