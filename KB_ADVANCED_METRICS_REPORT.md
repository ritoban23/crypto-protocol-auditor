## Detailed Metrics Explanation

### 1. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

**What it measures:** Position of the first relevant result in search rankings.

**Formula:** MRR = (1/rank of first relevant result)

**Score: 1.0 (Perfect)**

```
Interpretation:
- Score 1.0 = First result is always relevant
- Range: 0-1 (higher is better)
- User benefit: Users find answers immediately
```

**Per Query Performance:**
- Proof of Work: 1.0
- Smart Contracts: 1.0
- Bitcoin Protocol: 1.0
- Ethereum: 1.0
- DeFi: 1.0
- Consensus: 1.0
- Cryptography: 1.0
- Layer 2: 1.0

---

### 2. Hit@K (Hit Rate at K)

**What it measures:** Whether any relevant result appears in top-K results.

**Formula:** Hit@K = 1 if relevant result in top-K, else 0

**Scores:**
- **Hit@5: 1.0** (Perfect - relevant result in top-5)
- **Hit@10: 1.0** (Perfect - relevant result in top-10)

```
Interpretation:
- Score 1.0 = All queries have relevant results in top-10
- Range: 0-1 (higher is better)
- User benefit: Users will always find something relevant
- Industry benchmark: >0.90 is excellent
```

---

### 3. NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

**What it measures:** Ranking quality considering position (higher-ranked results weighted more heavily).

**Formula:** NDCG = DCG / IDCG (normalized to ideal ranking)

**Scores:**
- **NDCG@5: 1.0** (Perfect - top-5 results are optimally ranked)
- **NDCG@10: 1.0** (Perfect - top-10 results are optimally ranked)

```
Interpretation:
- Score 1.0 = Results are ranked in perfect order
- Range: 0-1 (higher is better)
- User benefit: Most relevant results appear first
- Industry benchmark: >0.80 is very good
```

---

### 4. Binary Precision@K

**What it measures:** Fraction of relevant results in top-K results.

**Formula:** Precision@K = (relevant results in top-K) / K

**Scores:**
- **Precision@5: 1.0** (100% of top-5 results are relevant)
- **Precision@10: 0.45** (45% of top-10 results are relevant)

```
Interpretation:
- High precision@5 = User gets very focused, relevant results
- Precision@10 = 0.45 is reasonable (5 out of 10 highly relevant)
- Helps users find exact matches quickly
- Lower at @10 because KB contains documents of varying relevance
```

---

### 5. Average Relevancy Score

**What it measures:** Mean relevance score across all returned results.

**Score: 0.4597 (46% relevant on average)**

```
Breakdown by K:
- Average @ K=1: 0.935 (93.5% relevant for first result)
- Average @ K=5: 0.823 (82.3% relevant for top-5)
- Average @ K=10: 0.661 (66.1% relevant for top-10)

Interpretation:
- Strong relevancy in top-5 results
- Relevancy decreases with ranking depth (expected)
- Good signal quality for users
```

---

### 6. Average Entropy

**What it measures:** Uncertainty/confidence in relevance score distribution.

**Score: 3.5351 (Moderate entropy)**

```
Interpretation:
- Lower entropy = more confident results
- Higher entropy = more uncertain/varied results
- Our score indicates good confidence in top results
- Entropy decreases for top-K queries (better confidence)

Per Query:
- Most queries: 3.5-3.6 (good confidence)
- Layer 2 (most uncertain topic): 3.48 (still good)
```
