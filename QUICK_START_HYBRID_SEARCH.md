# ⚡ Quick Start: Hybrid Search for You

## What You Need to Do

### 1️⃣ Start the App
```bash
cd "c:\Users\KIIT\Desktop\crypto protocol auditor\crypto-auditor-app"
npm run dev
```
→ App opens at `http://localhost:3001`

---

### 2️⃣ Test the Hybrid Search

Open the app and you'll see **3 search mode buttons**:
- **🧠 Semantic** - For natural language questions
- **🔤 Keyword** - For specific terms and acronyms
- **🔀 Hybrid** - Smart mode (recommended, auto-detects)

**Try these test queries:**

| Query | Best Mode | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| `BTC` | 🔀 Hybrid or 🔤 Keyword | Acronym - needs keyword matching |
| `How does proof-of-work function?` | 🔀 Hybrid or 🧠 Semantic | Natural language |
| `Bitcoin consensus mechanism` | 🔀 Hybrid | Mixed (auto-balances) |
| `Ethereum PoS staking rewards` | 🔀 Hybrid | Mixed acronym + concepts |
| `What is a blockchain?` | 🧠 Semantic | Conceptual question |

---

### 3️⃣ What to Observe

Each result shows:
- **🎯 Search Mode Badge** (top-left) - Shows which mode was used
- **📊 Relevance %** (top-right) - Color coded:
  - 🟢 Green = 80%+ (highly relevant)
  - 🔵 Blue = 70-80% (relevant)
  - 🟡 Yellow = <70% (somewhat relevant)
- **📄 Source** - Which document
- **🏷️ Category** - L1, DeFi, etc.

---

### 4️⃣ How It Works Automatically

The **🔀 Hybrid mode** is smart:

```
Your Query → Analyze → Decide Balance → Search
   ↓           ↓           ↓             ↓
"BTC" → Found acronym → Favor keywords → Results with BTC
   
"blockchain question" → Natural language → Favor semantics → Conceptual results

"Bitcoin PoW consensus" → Mixed → Balance both → Best of both worlds
```

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Search mode buttons are clickable
- [ ] Can type in search box
- [ ] Results appear with badges
- [ ] Try acronym query: Notice keyword-focused results
- [ ] Try natural language: Notice conceptual results
- [ ] Try Hybrid mode: Notice it adapts automatically
- [ ] Check browser console (F12): See alpha values and search mode
- [ ] Different modes give different result rankings

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

**Results show "Unknown Project"?**
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors. Should be fixed with latest code.

**All results are same quality?**
→ This is normal! Try switching modes to see the difference.

**Nothing happens on search?**
→ Check backend is still running in terminal. Should see query logs.

**Console shows errors?**
→ Take a screenshot of the error and share it.

## 📊 Understanding Results

### Compare Search Modes for Same Query: "Bitcoin consensus"

**🧠 Semantic Mode Results:**
```
1. "Understanding blockchain consensus mechanisms" - 89%
2. "How Bitcoin validates transactions" - 85%
3. "Proof-of-work vs Proof-of-stake" - 82%
(Conceptually similar, but word variations)
```

**🔤 Keyword Mode Results:**
```
1. "Bitcoin consensus algorithm" - 92%
2. "Bitcoin PoW implementation details" - 88%
(Exact word matches get highest scores)
```

**🔀 Hybrid Mode Results:**
```
1. "Bitcoin consensus algorithm" - 95%
2. "Understanding blockchain consensus" - 88%
3. "How Bitcoin validates transactions" - 84%
(Best of both: exact matches + concepts)
```

---

## 🔍 Advanced: Understanding Alpha (For Later)

Alpha controls the balance:
- `0` = 100% keyword search (exact matches only)
- `0.3` = 30% semantic, 70% keyword (good for acronyms)
- `0.5` = 50% each (balanced)
- `0.7` = 70% semantic, 30% keyword (good for concepts)
- `1` = 100% semantic search (natural language)

**The app auto-detects and sets this!** You don't need to adjust it usually.

## 📈 What Happens Next?

After you test and confirm it works:

1. **Add Live Data**
   - Integration with crypto prices (CoinGecko API)
   - Answer: "What is Bitcoin's price and consensus mechanism?"

2. **Performance Tuning**
   - Fine-tune alpha values if needed
   - Add filtering options

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Custom search parameters
   - Saved search history
   - Better ranking

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with 🔀 Hybrid** - It's smart enough for most queries
2. **Use 🔤 Keyword for acronyms** - BTC, ETH, POW, etc.
3. **Use 🧠 Semantic for questions** - How, what, why, etc.
4. **Check console logs** - F12 shows alpha and search mode
5. **Try both modes** - See how different they can be

---

## ✨ You're All Set!

Everything is implemented and ready to test. Just:

1. Start the app
2. Type a query
3. Notice the search mode badge
4. Watch results rank by relevance
5. Try different queries and modes
6. Check the console to see how it works
