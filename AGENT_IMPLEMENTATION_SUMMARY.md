# ü§ñ Advanced Agent Path: Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

A **MindsDB Agent** that intelligently routes queries to:
- Knowledge Base (static whitepaper data)
- Price API (live market data)
- Both simultaneously (combined insights)

## üéØ What the Agent Does

### Query Classification

The agent automatically detects query type:

```
User Query: "What is Bitcoin's proof of work?"
    ‚Üì
Classification: kb_only
    ‚Üì
Action: Search knowledge base
    ‚Üì
Result: Protocol information from whitepapers

---

User Query: "What's the current Bitcoin price?"
    ‚Üì
Classification: price_only
    ‚Üì
Action: Fetch from price API
    ‚Üì
Result: Live market data

---

User Query: "What's Bitcoin's consensus and current price?"
    ‚Üì
Classification: combined
    ‚Üì
Action: Execute KB search + price fetch in parallel
    ‚Üì
Result: Both technical + market insights
```

### Classification Keywords

**Technical (KB Search):**
```
consensus, whitepaper, protocol, algorithm, mechanism, 
network, validation, mining, stake, hash, block, 
transaction, security, cryptography, smart contract,
proof of work, proof of stake, Byzantine
```

**Price (Price API):**
```
price, cost, worth, market, trading, bullish, bearish,
chart, volume, marketcap, market cap, usd, expensive
```

**Projects (Auto-detection):**
```
bitcoin (btc), ethereum (eth), solana (sol), cardano (ada),
polkadot (dot), ripple (xrp), litecoin (ltc), dogecoin (doge),
polygon (matic), arbitrum (arb), optimism (op)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start: 3 Steps

### Step 1: Set Up MindsDB Tables (10 minutes)

Open MindsDB SQL Editor at `http://127.0.0.1:47334`

Run these commands:

```sql
-- 1. Verify KB table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM web3_kb;

-- 2. Create agent rules view
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS crypto_auditor_agent_rules AS
SELECT 
    'rule_1' as rule_id,
    'kb_only' as query_type,
    'Search knowledge base' as action
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'rule_2',
    'price_only',
    'Fetch price data'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'rule_3',
    'combined',
    'Execute both in parallel';

-- 3. Create operations log
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agent_operations_log (
    operation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    query_text TEXT,
    detected_query_type VARCHAR(50),
    kb_executed BOOLEAN,
    price_executed BOOLEAN,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 4. Verify everything
SELECT * FROM crypto_auditor_agent_rules;
SELECT * FROM agent_operations_log LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ All tables/views created successfully

---

### Step 2: Test Agent Backend Locally (5 minutes)

Test the agent endpoint directly:

```bash
# Using curl or your API client
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is Bitcoin and what is its current price?",
    "context": {
      "searchMode": "auto",
      "maxResults": 3
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "queryId": "q_1730375400000_abc123",
  "originalQuery": "What is Bitcoin and what is its current price?",
  "classifiedAs": "combined",
  "results": {
    "kb_results": [
      {
        "content": "Bitcoin uses Proof of Work...",
        "relevance": 0.89,
        "source": "bitcoin_whitepaper.pdf",
        "searchMode": "semantic"
      }
    ],
    "price_results": [
      {
        "project": "bitcoin",
        "price_usd": 45123.45,
        "market_cap_usd": 892345000000,
        "price_change_24h": 5.2
      }
    ],
    "kbSearchComplete": true,
    "priceSearchComplete": true
  },
  "executedAt": {
    "kb_search_ms": 245,
    "price_fetch_ms": 180,
    "total_ms": 425
  },
  "agentReasoning": "Query contains both price terms (1) and technical terms (1). Executing both KB search and price fetch."
}
```

**Check:** If you get results, the agent is working! ‚úÖ

---

### Step 3: Integrate into Frontend (Next)

Update `/app/page.tsx` to use the agent endpoint (instead of calling search/prices separately).

We'll do this together after verifying Steps 1-2.

---

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: KB-Only Query
**Query:** `"What is Proof of Stake?"`
**Expected Classification:** `kb_only`
**Expected Result:** Only KB results

**Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is Proof of Stake?"}'
```

---

### Test 2: Price-Only Query
**Query:** `"What is the price of Ethereum?"`
**Expected Classification:** `price_only`
**Expected Result:** Only price results

**Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the price of Ethereum?"}'
```

---

### Test 3: Combined Query
**Query:** `"Tell me about Bitcoin consensus and show current BTC price"`
**Expected Classification:** `combined`
**Expected Result:** Both KB + price results

**Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Tell me about Bitcoin consensus and show current BTC price"}'
```

---

### Test 4: Auto Mode (Ambiguous)
**Query:** `"Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum"`
**Expected Classification:** `auto`
**Expected Result:** Probably both (since no clear price/tech keywords)

**Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum"}'
```

## üìã What You'll Do Now

### Phase 1: MindsDB Setup (You're here)

**Run these steps in MindsDB SQL Editor:**

1. **STEP 1:** Verify KB table exists
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM web3_kb;
   ```

2. **STEP 2:** Create agent rules
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS crypto_auditor_agent_rules AS
   SELECT 'rule_1' as rule_id, 'kb_only' as query_type
   UNION ALL SELECT 'rule_2', 'price_only'
   UNION ALL SELECT 'rule_3', 'combined';
   ```

3. **STEP 3:** Create operations log
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agent_operations_log (
       operation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       query_text TEXT,
       detected_query_type VARCHAR(50),
       kb_executed BOOLEAN,
       price_executed BOOLEAN,
       timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

4. **STEP 4:** Verify
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM crypto_auditor_agent_rules;
   SELECT * FROM agent_operations_log LIMIT 1;
   ```

**Tell me:** When you've completed steps 1-4, reply with ‚úÖ

---

### Phase 2: Test Agent Endpoint

**Run the test queries from the "Testing Scenarios" section above**

**What to check:**
- Does the API respond?
- Is the query correctly classified?
- Do you get both KB and price results for combined queries?

**Tell me:** Screenshot or paste the response you get

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration

Once Phase 1 & 2 work, we'll update:
- `/app/page.tsx` to use `/api/agent/query` endpoint
- Display combined results beautifully
- Show agent's reasoning for transparency

---

## üîç How to Check Each Component

### Check MindsDB is Running
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:47334
```
Should return 200 OK

### Check Price API is Accessible
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/prices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projects": ["bitcoin"]}'
```
Should return price data

### Check Agent Endpoint is Ready
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query
```
Should return health check info

---

## üìä Agent Response Anatomy

Every agent response has this structure:

```json
{
  "queryId": "unique_id_for_tracking",
  "originalQuery": "what the user asked",
  "classifiedAs": "kb_only | price_only | combined | auto",
  "results": {
    "kb_results": [...],      // if KB was executed
    "price_results": [...],   // if price fetch was executed
    "kbSearchComplete": true,
    "priceSearchComplete": true
  },
  "executedAt": {
    "kb_search_ms": 245,      // time for KB search
    "price_fetch_ms": 180,    // time for price fetch
    "total_ms": 425           // total response time
  },
  "agentReasoning": "Why the agent made this decision..."
}
```

---

## üêõ Debugging

### If Agent Returns Empty Results

**Check 1:** Is MindsDB running?
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:47334
```

**Check 2:** Does KB table have data?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM web3_kb;
```

**Check 3:** Is price API working?
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/prices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projects": ["bitcoin"]}'
```

**Check 4:** View agent logs
```bash
# In your Next.js terminal, look for console logs with [Agent ...]
```
