# 🚀 START HERE: Your Next 5 Steps

## ✨ What We Just Built

A **MindsDB Agent** that intelligently combines:
- 📚 Knowledge Base searches (whitepapers)
- 💰 Live price data (CoinGecko)
- 🎯 Smart query routing (automatically decides what to do)

---

## 📍 Current Status

```
✅ Agent backend: READY
✅ Price API: READY  
✅ KB search: READY
✅ Documentation: COMPLETE
⏳ MindsDB setup: WAITING FOR YOU
🚫 Frontend integration: NOT YET
```

---

## 🎯 Your 5-Step Action Plan

### STEP 1: Open MindsDB SQL Editor (2 min)

**Do this:**
1. Open browser
2. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:47334`
3. Look for "SQL Editor" or query button
4. You should see a SQL text input area

**Expected:** Large SQL input box with "Execute" or "▶️ Run" button

---

### STEP 2: Verify Your Data (3 min)

**Copy and paste this into MindsDB:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_documents FROM web3_kb;
```

**Click Execute/Run**

**Expected Result:**
```
total_documents: 1250+
```

**If you get this:** ✅ Good! Your KB has data. Continue to Step 3.

**If you get error:** ⚠️ Let me know the exact error message.

---

### STEP 3: Create Agent Infrastructure (3 min)

**Copy and paste this ENTIRE block into MindsDB:**

```sql
-- Create agent rules view
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS crypto_auditor_agent_rules AS
SELECT 
    'rule_1' as rule_id,
    'kb_only' as query_type,
    'Search knowledge base with hybrid search' as action
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'rule_2',
    'price_only',
    'Fetch live price data from API'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'rule_3',
    'combined',
    'Execute both KB search and price fetch in parallel';

-- Create operations log table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agent_operations_log (
    operation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    query_text TEXT,
    detected_query_type VARCHAR(50),
    kb_executed BOOLEAN,
    price_executed BOOLEAN,
    kb_results_count INT,
    price_results_count INT,
    total_time_ms INT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Verify creation
SELECT * FROM crypto_auditor_agent_rules;
SELECT * FROM agent_operations_log LIMIT 1;
```

**Click Execute/Run**

**Expected Result:**
```
4 rows returned from agent_rules
0 rows from agent_operations_log (table is empty - normal)
```

**If you get this:** ✅ Perfect! Infrastructure is set up. Move to Step 4.

**If you get error:** ⚠️ Let me know the exact error message.

---

### STEP 4: Test Agent Endpoint (5 min)

**Open Terminal/PowerShell and run this:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"query": "What is Bitcoin and what is its current price?"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "queryId": "q_...",
  "originalQuery": "What is Bitcoin and what is its current price?",
  "classifiedAs": "combined",
  "results": {
    "kb_results": [...],
    "price_results": [...],
    "kbSearchComplete": true,
    "priceSearchComplete": true
  },
  "executedAt": {
    "kb_search_ms": 245,
    "price_fetch_ms": 180,
    "total_ms": 425
  }
}
```

**If you get this:** ✅ Excellent! Agent is working. Move to Step 5.

**If you get error or empty:** ⚠️ Let me know the response you got.

---

### STEP 5: Try More Test Queries (3 min)

**Test KB-Only Query:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"query": "Explain Proof of Stake consensus"}'
```

Expected: `classifiedAs: "kb_only"` with only KB results

**Test Price-Only Query:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"query": "What is the price of Ethereum?"}'
```

Expected: `classifiedAs: "price_only"` with only price results

**If both work:** ✅ Agent classification is working perfectly!

## 🎉 After These 5 Steps

Once you complete steps 1-5:

### I Will Build:
1. **Frontend Integration** - Update `/app/page.tsx` to use the agent
2. **UI Display** - Show combined KB + price results beautifully
3. **Agent Reasoning** - Display WHY the agent made each decision

### Time Estimate:
- Steps 1-5: **15-20 minutes**
- Frontend integration: **30 minutes**
- End-to-end testing: **10 minutes**
- **Total: ~1 hour** to complete the entire advanced path ✨

---

## 📋 Communication Protocol

### When You Complete Each Step, Say:

**After Step 1:** "✅ MindsDB editor open"
**After Step 2:** "✅ KB verified - has X documents"
**After Step 3:** "✅ Infrastructure created"
**After Step 4:** "✅ Agent endpoint responds - [paste 2-3 lines of response]"
**After Step 5:** "✅ All test queries working"

### If You Hit Issues:

Say something like:
- "⚠️ Step 2 - getting 'table not found' error"
- "⚠️ Step 4 - curl returns empty response"
- "⚠️ Step 5 - test query classified wrong"

And paste the **exact error message** or response you're getting.

## 🔍 Visual: What Happens at Each Step

```
STEP 1: Open MindsDB
│
├─→ See SQL editor interface
└─→ If not found, check: http://127.0.0.1:47334

STEP 2: Query KB Table
│
├─→ SQL returns count ≥ 1000
└─→ If 0, KB is empty (problem)

STEP 3: Create Infrastructure
│
├─→ Create agent_rules view
├─→ Create agent_operations_log table
└─→ Both should succeed with no errors

STEP 4: Test Agent Endpoint
│
├─→ Send query to http://localhost:3001/api/agent/query
├─→ Agent classifies query
├─→ Executes KB search + price fetch
└─→ Returns combined response

STEP 5: Verify Classification
│
├─→ kb_only query → only KB results
├─→ price_only query → only price results
├─→ combined query → both results
└─→ If all match expectations: SUCCESS! ✅
```

| 2 | Verify KB | 3 min | ✅ Count ≥ 1000 |
| 3 | Create Infrastructure | 3 min | ✅ No errors |
| 4 | Test Agent | 5 min | ✅ Gets response |
| 5 | Test Classifications | 3 min | ✅ All 3 queries work |
| **TOTAL** | **Setup Complete** | **~16 min** | **Ready for Frontend** |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Links

**"Can't access MindsDB"** → Make sure `docker-compose up -d` was run

**"KB table not found"** → Check if MindsDB and PGVector are both running

**"Agent returns empty"** → KB search might not be working (check MindsDB connection)

**"Classification wrong"** → Agent keywords might need tuning (I can help)
